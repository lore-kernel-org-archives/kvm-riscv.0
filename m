This series extends perf support for KVM. The KVM implementation relies
on the SBI PMU extension and trap n emulation of hpmcounter CSRs.
The KVM implementation exposes the virtual counters to the guest and internally
manage the counters using kernel perf counters. 

This series doesn't support the counter overflow as the Sscofpmf extension
doesn't allow trap & emulation mechanism of scountovf CSR yet. The required
changes to allow that are being under discussions. Supporting overflow interrupt
also requires AIA interrupt filtering support.

perf stat works in kvm guests with this series. 

Here is example of running perf stat in a guest running in KVM.

Note: The SBI_PMU_FW_SET_TIMER (eventid : r8000000000000005) is zero
as kvm guest supports sstc now.

TODO:
1. Add sscofpmf support.
2. Add One reg interface for the following operations:
	1. Enable/Disable PMU (should it at VM level rather than vcpu ?)
	2. Number of hpmcounter and width of the counters
	3. Init PMU
	4. Allow guest user to access cycle & instret without trapping
3. Move counter mask to a bitmask instead of unsigned long so that it can work
   for RV32 systems where number of total counters are more than 32.
   This will also accomodate future systems which may define maximum counters
   to be more than 64. 

Changes from v5->v6:
1. Addressed remainig RB tags.
2. Rebased on kvm-queue which already has merged first 6 patches from v5.
3. Added static time compilation checks for max counters.
4. Addressed other nit comments.

Changes from v4->v5:
1. Few checkpatch --strict error fixes.
2. Some other minor nit comment addressed.
3. Fixed an issue around counter indexing.

Changes from v3->v4:
1. Addressed all the comments on v3.
2. Modified the vcpu_pmu_init to void return type.
3. Redirect illegal instruction trap to guest for invalid hpmcounter access
   instead of exiting to the userpsace.
4. Got rid of unecessary error messages.

Changes v2->v3:
1. Changed the exported functions to GPL only export.
2. Addressed all the nit comments on v2.
3. Split non-kvm related changes into separate patches.
4. Reorgainze the PATCH 11 and 10 based on Drew's suggestions.

Changes from v1->v2:
1. Addressed comments from Andrew.
2. Removed kvpmu sanity check.
3. Added a kvm pmu init flag and the sanity check to probe function.
4. Improved the linux vs sbi error code handling.
