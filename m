Getting to the really important stuff...

Anyone object to naming the new file guest_memfd.c instead of guest_mem.c?  Just
the file, i.e. still keep the gmem namespace.

Using guest_memfd.c would make it much more obvious that the file holds more than
generic "guest memory" APIs, and would provide a stronger conceptual connection
with memfd.c.
