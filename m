Right, it was pretty old and I have no idea if that was discussed or
published before..  It would be better to have discussed this earlier.

As long as we have a decision with that being aware and in mind, then it
looks fine to me to take either way to go, and I also agree either way is
better than keep the status quo.

I also have Andrea copied anyway when I replied, so I guess he should be
aware of this and he can chim in anytime.

Thanks!
