I can definitely add a comment, but I think that comment is incorrect.  AIUI,
the CPU is the one thing in the system that _doesn't_ set ON, at least not without
IPI virtualization (haven't read that spec yet).  KVM (software) sets it when
emulating IPIs, and the IOMMU (hardware) sets it for "real" posted interrupts,
but the CPU (sans IPI virtualization) only clears ON when processing an IRQ on
the notification vector.

So something like this?

	/* ON can be set concurrently by a different vCPU or by hardware. */
