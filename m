Yeah, that bothers me too.

I tried your suggestion of having x86's kvm_arch_sched_in() do kvm_arch_vcpu_load(),
and even with an added kvm_arch_sched_out() to provide symmetry, the x86 code is
kludgy, and even the common code is a bit confusing as it's not super obvious
that kvm_sched_{in,out}() is really just kvm_arch_vcpu_{load,put}().

Staring a bit more at the vCPU flags we have, adding a "bool scheduled_out" isn't
terribly gross if it's done in common code and persists across load() and put(),
i.e. isn't so blatantly a temporary field.  And because it's easy, it could be
set with WRITE_ONCE() so that if it can be read cross-task if there's ever a
reason to do so.

The x86 code ends up being less ugly, and adding future arch/vendor code for
sched_in() *or* sched_out() requires minimal churn, e.g. arch code doesn't need
to override kvm_arch_sched_in().

The only weird part is that vcpu->preempted and vcpu->ready have slightly
different behavior, as they are cleared before kvm_arch_vcpu_load().  But the
weirdness is really with those flags no having symmetry, not with scheduled_out
itself.

Thoughts?

static void kvm_sched_in(struct preempt_notifier *pn, int cpu)
{
	struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu = preempt_notifier_to_vcpu(pn);

	WRITE_ONCE(vcpu->preempted, false);
	WRITE_ONCE(vcpu->ready, false);

	__this_cpu_write(kvm_running_vcpu, vcpu);
	kvm_arch_vcpu_load(vcpu, cpu);

	WRITE_ONCE(vcpu->scheduled_out, false);
}

static void kvm_sched_out(struct preempt_notifier *pn,
			  struct task_struct *next)
{
	struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu = preempt_notifier_to_vcpu(pn);

	WRITE_ONCE(vcpu->scheduled_out, true);

	if (current->on_rq) {
		WRITE_ONCE(vcpu->preempted, true);
		WRITE_ONCE(vcpu->ready, true);
	}
	kvm_arch_vcpu_put(vcpu);
	__this_cpu_write(kvm_running_vcpu, NULL);
}
