The "full" WARN is desirable, this is effecitvely an assert on the contract between
the primary MMU, generic KVM code, and x86's TDP MMU.  The .change_pte() mmu_notifier
callback doesn't allow for hugepages, i.e. it's a (likely fatal) kernel bug if a
hugepage is encountered at this point.  Ditto for the "start + 1 == end" check,
if that fails then generic KVM likely has a fatal bug.

The return value communicates whether or not a TLB flush is needed, not whether
or not the operation was successful, i.e. there is no way to cancel the unexpected
PTE change.
