Subject: [PATCH v4 00/10] KVM: Register cpuhp/syscore callbacks when enabling virt

Register KVM's cpuhp and syscore callbacks when enabling virtualization in
hardware, as the sole purpose of said callbacks is to disable and re-enable
virtualization as needed.

The primary motivation for this series is to simplify dealing with enabling
virtualization for Intel's TDX, which needs to enable virtualization
when kvm-intel.ko is loaded, i.e. long before the first VM is created.

That said, this is a nice cleanup on its own.  By registering the callbacks
on-demand, the callbacks themselves don't need to check kvm_usage_count,
because their very existence implies a non-zero count.

Patch 1 (re)adds a dedicated lock for kvm_usage_count.  Hopefully it's a
temporary lock, as we can likely fix the cpus_read_lock() vs. kvm_lock mess
for good by switching vm_list to an (S)RCU-protected list.

v4:
 - Collect more reviews.
 - Fix documentation for kvm_usage_lock. [Kai]
 - Add a blurb in locking.rst to call out that cpus_read_lock() vs kvm_lock is
   a general problem.
 - Add a paragraph in the locking patch to suggest switching vm_list to an
   (S)RCU-protected list, so that walkers don't need to take kvm_lock.
 - Add an example call chain for the other cpus_read_lock() vs kvm_lock issues
   that are lurking.
 - Enable the module param by default from the get-go. [Paolo]
 - Rename even more APIs/symbols (all of 'em I could find). [Paolo]
 - Clarify that it's the 0=>1 VM creation that's problematic, not simply the
   creation of the very first VM. [Paolo]
 - Document enable_virt_at_load, and call out the (dis)advantages of enabling
   virtualization when KVM is loaded.
 - Drop the WARN on kvm_usage_count being elevated at the end of
   kvm_uninit_virtualization(), as it's annoyingly difficult to keep the WARN
   and still allow arch code (i.e. TDX) to enable virtualization during setup.

v3:
 - https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240608000639.3295768-1-seanjc at google.com
 - Collect reviews/acks.
 - Switch to kvm_usage_lock in a dedicated patch, Cc'd for stable at . [Chao]
 - Enable virt at load by default. [Chao]
 - Add comments to document how kvm_arch_{en,dis}able_virtualization() fit
   into the overall flow. [Kai]

v2:
 - https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240522022827.1690416-1-seanjc at google.com
 - Use a dedicated mutex to avoid lock inversion issues between kvm_lock and
   the cpuhp lock.
 - Register emergency disable callbacks on-demand. [Kai]
 - Drop an unintended s/junk/ign rename. [Kai]
 - Decrement kvm_usage_count on failure. [Chao]
