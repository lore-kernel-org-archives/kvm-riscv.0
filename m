0 values don't require an entry in the xarray, i.e. don't need to be stored and
so don't consume memory.  The potential conflict with a RWX=0 entry has already
been noted, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it, e.g. KVM can easily
support RWX=0 by using an internal "valid" flag.

Yeah, on the todo list, all of the changelogs are horribly stale.
