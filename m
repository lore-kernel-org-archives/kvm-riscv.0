Direct reclaim is multi-threaded and each reclaimer can take the mmu
lock for read (testing the A-bit) or write (unmapping before paging
out) on arm64. The fundamental problem of using the readers-writer
lock in this case is priority inversion: the readers have lower
priority than the writers, so ideally, we don't want the readers to
block the writers at all.

Using my previous (crude) analogy: puting the bill right in front of
you (the writers) profits immediately whereas searching for the
largest bill (the readers) can be futile.

As I said earlier, I prefer we drop the arm64 support for now, but I
will not object to taking the mmu lock for read when clearing the
A-bit, as long as we fully understand the problem here and document it
clearly.
