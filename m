Subject: [PATCH 02/44] KVM: Initialize IRQ FD after arch hardware setup

Move initialization of KVM's IRQ FD workqueue below arch hardware setup
as a step towards consolidating arch "init" and "hardware setup", and
eventually towards dropping the hooks entirely.  There is no dependency
on the workqueue being created before hardware setup, the workqueue is
used only when destroying VMs, i.e. only needs to be created before
/dev/kvm is exposed to userspace.

Move the destruction of the workqueue before the arch hooks to maintain
symmetry, and so that arch code can move away from the hooks without
having to worry about ordering changes.

Reword the comment about kvm_irqfd_init() needing to come after
kvm_arch_init() to call out that kvm_arch_init() must come before common
KVM does _anything_, as x86 very subtly relies on that behavior to deal
with multiple calls to kvm_init(), e.g. if userspace attempts to load
kvm_amd.ko and kvm_intel.ko.  Tag the code with a FIXME, as x86's subtle
requirement is gross, and invoking an arch callback as the very first
action in a helper that is called only from arch code is silly.
