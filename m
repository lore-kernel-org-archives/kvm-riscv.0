Hmm, I recall that all the S390 drivers need it as well.

static int vfio_ap_mdev_open_device(struct vfio_device *vdev)
{
        struct ap_matrix_mdev *matrix_mdev =
                container_of(vdev, struct ap_matrix_mdev, vdev);

        if (!vdev->kvm)
                return -EINVAL;

        return vfio_ap_mdev_set_kvm(matrix_mdev, vdev->kvm);


I wonder if we should be making the VFIO drivers that need the kvm to
ask for it? 'select CONFIG_NEED_VFIO_KVM' or something?

Regardless, I fully agree with getting rid of the arch flag.

I wonder if kvm-m magically works in kbuild so you don't need the ifdef?
