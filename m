Ah, so KVM vs TCG is a red herring and it's actually "some guest
firmware doesn't enable the FPU itself, and if you run that then it will
fall over, whether you do it in KVM or TCG" ? That makes more sense.

I don't have an opinion on whether you want to do that or not,
not knowing what the riscv architecture mandates. (On Arm this
would be fairly clearly "the guest software is broken and
should be fixed", but that's because the Arm architecture
says you can't assume the FPU is enabled from reset.)

I do think the commit message could use clarification to
explain this.

thanks
