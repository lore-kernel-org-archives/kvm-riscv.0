This series extends KVM RISC-V to allow Guest/VM discover and use
conditional operations related ISA extensions (namely XVentanaCondOps
and Zicond).

To try these patches, use KVMTOOL from riscv_zbx_zicntr_smstateen_condops_v1
branch at: https://github.com/avpatel/kvmtool.git

These patches are based upon the latest riscv_kvm_queue and can also be
found in the riscv_kvm_condops_v2 branch at:
https://github.com/avpatel/linux.git

Changes since v1:
 - Rebased the series on riscv_kvm_queue
 - Split PATCH1 and PATCH2 of v1 series into two patches
 - Added separate test configs for XVentanaCondOps and Zicond in PATCH7
   of v1 series.
