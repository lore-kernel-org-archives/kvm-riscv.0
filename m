Please omit the massive comments, they are yet another misguided remnant in
selftests that we are purging.

Strictly speaking, CS.DPL is not the source of truth for CPL, SS.DPL is.  But
that's probably a moot point, because I again think this is a hack that shows the
overall approach isn't maintainable.

Can you post the actual usage of userspace selftests, i.e. the "full" series?
It's really hard to build a mental model of how this all fits together without
seeing the actual usage.
