The patch enables it only for KSM, so it would still require a bunch
of cleanups, for example I also would still use set_pte_at() in all
the places that are not KSM. This would at least fix the issue with
the poor documentation of where to use set_pte_at_notify() vs
set_pte_at().

With regard to the implementation, I like the idea of disabling the
invalidation on the MMU notifier side, but I would rather have
MMU_NOTIFIER_CHANGE_PTE as a separate field in the range instead of
overloading the event field.

I have just learnt about the patch, nobody had ever mentioned it even
though it's almost 2 years old... It's a lot of code though and no one
has ever reported an issue for over 10 years, so I think it's easiest
to just rip the code out.
