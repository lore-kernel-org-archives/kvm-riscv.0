No, gfn_to_pfn_prot() == FOLL_GET, kfp->pin == FOLL_PIN.  But that's not really
relevant.

No, the conflict with dirty logging is specifically that this code doesn't invoke
mark_page_dirty().  And it can't easily do that, because there's no loaded ("running")
vCPU, i.e. doing so would trip this WARN:

#ifdef CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_DIRTY_RING
	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(vcpu && vcpu->kvm != kvm))
		return;

	WARN_ON_ONCE(!vcpu && !kvm_arch_allow_write_without_running_vcpu(kvm)); <====
#endif
