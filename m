This explanation doesn't make much sense to me.  This is just the usual 
request/kick pattern explained in 
Documentation/virt/kvm/vcpu-requests.rst; except that we don't bother 
with a "kick" out of guest mode because the entry always goes through 
kvm_check_request (in the nVMX case) or sync_pir_to_irr (if non-nested) 
and completes the delivery itself.

In other word, it is a similar idea as patch 43/43.

What this smp_wmb() pair with, is the smp_mb__after_atomic in 
kvm_check_request(KVM_REQ_EVENT, vcpu).  Setting the interrupt in the 
PIR orders before kvm_make_request in this thread, and orders after 
kvm_make_request in the vCPU thread.

Here, instead:

it pairs with the smp_mb__after_atomic in vmx_sync_pir_to_irr().  As 
explained again in vcpu-requests.rst, the ON bit has the same function 
as vcpu->request in the previous case.
