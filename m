I've finally managed to get virtio-vulkan working on my Arm64 devbox
with an AMD graphics card plugged into the PCI. I'm confident that the
graphics path is using the discrete card memory (as it has been mapped
as device memory with alignment handlers to deal with the broken Altra
PCI). However aside from running graphics workloads in KVM guests is
their anything else I can check to see things are behaving as expected?

The predecessor series did break launching some KVM guests on my x86
system but with this series launching guests works fine and I haven't
noticed any weirdness.

So for those caveats you can certainly have a:
