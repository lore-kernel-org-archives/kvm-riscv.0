Huh.  It took my brain a while to catch up, but this seems comically obvious in
hindsight.  I *love* this approach, both conceptually and from a code perspective.

Handing VFIO (and any other external entities) a file makes it so that KVM effectively
interacts with users via files, regardless of whether the user lives in userspace
or the kernel.  That makes it easier to reason about the safety of operations,
e.g. in addition to ensuring KVM-the-module is pinned, having a file pointer allows
KVM to verify that the incoming pointer does indeed represent a VM.  Which isn't
necessary by any means, but it's a nice sanity check.

From a code perspective, it's far cleaner than manually grabbing module references,
and having only a file pointers makes it a wee bit harder for non-KVM code to
poke into KVM, e.g. keeps us honest.

Assuming nothing blows up in testing, I'll go this route for v2.

Thanks!
