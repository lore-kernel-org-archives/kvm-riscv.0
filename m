Let me add back what I said earlier:

That's your methodology, which I respect: as I said I won't stand in your way.

But mine is backed by data, please do respect that as well, by doing
what I asked: document your justifications.

Sorry, are you saying "without documenting your justifications" is
nothing wrong? If so, please elaborate.

Please re-read my previous emails -- I never object to the removal of
the bitmap or James' approach.

And please stop making assumptions -- I did voice my concerns with
James privately.

Are you saying I faulted James for taking others' feedback? If so,
where? And I'll make sure I don't give such an impression in the
future.

Also what do you think about the technical flaws and inaccurate
understandings I pointed out? You seem to have a strong opinion on
your iterate approach, but I hope you didn't choose to overlook the
real meat of this discussion.
