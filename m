What page tables do we want to account? KVM on ARM manages several page
tables.

For regular KVM, the host kernel manages allocations for the hyp stage 1
tables in addition to the stage 2 tables used for a particular VM. The
former is system overhead whereas the latter could be attributed to a
guest VM.

I imagine protected KVM is out of scope, since it actually manages its
own allocations outside of the host kernel.

Given this, I would recommend adding the accounting hooks to mmu.c as
that is where we alloc/free table pages and it is in the host address
space. kvm_s2_mm_ops and kvm_hyp_mm_ops point to all the relevant
functions, though the latter is only relevant if we want to count system
page tables too.
