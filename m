Move the WARN sanity checks out of the PI descriptor update loop so as
not to spam the kernel log if the condition is violated and the update
takes multiple attempts due to another writer.  This also eliminates a
few extra uops from the retry path.

Technically not checking every attempt could mean KVM will now fail to
WARN in a scenario that would have failed before, but any such failure
would be inherently racy as some other agent (CPU or device) would have
to concurrent modify the PI descriptor.
