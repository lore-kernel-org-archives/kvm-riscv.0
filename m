I hate to bring this up because I doubt there's a real use case for SUSPEND with
TDX, but the CPU offline path isn't just for true offlining of CPUs.  When the
system enters SUSPEND, only the initiating CPU goes through kvm_suspend()+kvm_resume(),
all responding CPUs go through CPU offline+online.  I.e. disallowing all CPUs from
going "offline" will prevent suspending the system.

I don't see anything in the TDX series or the specs that suggests suspend+resume
is disallowed when TDX is enabled, so blocking that seems just as wrong as
preventing software from soft-offlining CPUs.
