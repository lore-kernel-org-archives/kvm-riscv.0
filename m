kvm_vcpu_check_block() is called while not in TASK_RUNNING, and therefore
it cannot sleep.  Writing to guest memory is therefore forbidden, but it
can happen on AMD processors if kvm_check_nested_events() causes a vmexit.

Fortunately, all events that are caught by kvm_check_nested_events() are
also recognized by kvm_vcpu_has_events() through vendor callbacks such as
kvm_x86_interrupt_allowed() or kvm_x86_ops.nested_ops->has_events(), so
remove the call and postpone the actual processing to vcpu_block().

Opportunistically honor the return of kvm_check_nested_events().  KVM
punted on the check in kvm_vcpu_running() because the only error path is
if vmx_complete_nested_posted_interrupt() fails, in which case KVM exits
to userspace with "internal error" i.e. the VM is likely dead anyways so
it wasn't worth overloading the return of kvm_vcpu_running().

Add the check mostly so that KVM is consistent with itself; the return of
the call via kvm_apic_accept_events()=>kvm_check_nested_events() that
immediately follows  _is_ checked.

This commit breaks delivery of a (virtualized) posted interrupt from
an L1 vCPU to a halted L2 vCPU.

Looking back at commit e6c67d8cf117 ("KVM: nVMX: Wake blocked vCPU in
guest-mode if pending interrupt in virtual APICv"), Liran wrote:

    Note that this also handles the case of nested posted-interrupt by the
    fact RVI is updated in vmx_complete_nested_posted_interrupt() which is
    called from kvm_vcpu_check_block() -> kvm_arch_vcpu_runnable() ->
    kvm_vcpu_running() -> vmx_check_nested_events() ->
    vmx_complete_nested_posted_interrupt().

Clearly, that is no longer the case.
