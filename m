Subject: [PATCH v5.5 09/30] KVM: MIPS: Drop pr_debug from memslot commit to

Remove an old (circa 2012) kvm_debug from kvm_arch_commit_memory_region()
to print basic information when committing a memslot change.  The primary
motivation for removing the kvm_debug is to avoid using @mem, the user
memory region, so that said param can be removed.

Alternatively, the debug message could be converted to use @new, but that
would require synthesizing select state to play nice with the DELETED
case, which will pass NULL for @new in the future.  And there's no
argument to be had for dumping generic information in an arch callback,
i.e. if there's a good reason for the debug message, then it belongs in
common KVM code where all architectures can benefit.
