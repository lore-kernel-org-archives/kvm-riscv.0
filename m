And dually if KVM were to return KVM_EXIT_INTR together with something 
other than -EINTR.

vcpu->run->immediate_exit preserves all exit reasons, but it's not a 
good idea that immediate_exit behaves different from a pending signal on 
entry to KVM_RUN (remember that immediate_exit was meant to be a better 
performing alternative to KVM_SET_SIGNAL_MASK).

In principle, vcpu->run->immediate_exit could return KVM_EXIT_INTR 
(perhaps even _should_, except that breaks selftests so at this point it 
is ABI).
