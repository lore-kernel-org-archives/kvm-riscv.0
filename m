Add this option so that one building the kernel can choose whether or
not they want to support walking the secondary MMU.

We want users to be able to blindly enable all lru_gen features to have
the best possible performance most of the time. Walking the secondary
MMU is mainly useful for be able to do proactive reclaim, and it is
possible that doing this can harm VM performance.

This option should be enabled by users who run VMs and also care to do
proactive aging/reclaim with MGLRU.

With this config option enabled, a user can still disable the
new functionality at runtime through sysfs.
